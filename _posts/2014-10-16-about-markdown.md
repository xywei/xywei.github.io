## What is Markdown

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## Syntax guide

Hereâ€™s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

### Headers

```
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
```

### Emphasis

```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*
```

### Lists

#### Unordered

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

#### Ordered

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b
```

### Links

```

### Blockquotes

```
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
```

### Inline code

```
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
```
